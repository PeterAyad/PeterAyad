<h2 align="center">Hi there! My name is Peter Ayad. 👋🏻🤓</h2>
<p align="center"> I'm a Computer Engineering Student, a Web Developer, and hopefully one day a hacker. 
I am currently passionate about Algorithm Designing, Problem Solving, and Cybersecurity.
Most of the time I am on my laptop coding, developing, and building things but when I'm not, you can find me on the exact same laptop either learning a new topic related to computing, gaming, or watching sitcoms. 😂</p>
